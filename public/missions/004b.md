# Mission // #004
## Rallying Cry

# Goals
- Convince the city-states of the HUC to rally under one banner, come to the aid of Evergreen, and continue the war against the Machine.

# Stakes
- If the HUC is not convinced to aid Evergreen, the Hercynians will most likely refuse to help Evergreen in the future.
